Abstarct:
In todayâ€™s time due to the recent innovations on the internet and the network applications and the widespread of internet and networks, 
it is now completely possible to conduct electronic commerce on the internet or through the local area networks, and the widespread computer and 
communication network promoted many users to transfer files and sensitive information through the network, this sensitive data requires special deal. 
Packet Tampering is of huge concern to many of the E commerce websites since it is possible to intercept packets between the client and the server and 
change the values like price, etc. For example, Few year ago Amazon came into news as many clients had bought 70000 Rs worth cameras for just 1000 Rs. 
This can be done by packet intercepting tools like Burpsuite. Our aim is to show how this weakness can be prevented using encryption and hashing, so that
even if one intercepts the package it will be impossible to change the values as they are encrypted and hashed
